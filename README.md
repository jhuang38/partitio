# TODOS
- utilize MUI more
- optimize login logic (currently, essentially goes through 2 cycles of login)
- sort new array values by time initially created when edited
- move modal component logic to separate file, have other components with modals just use props to make modal work
- add good documentation
- deploy via AWS EC2
